# Tiny test: 6 points, 5 ranges
# Expected optimal hitting set size: 3
# One possible optimal solution: {0, 3, 4} or {1, 2, 5}
# 
# Range 0: {0, 1, 4}  - needs at least one of these
# Range 1: {0, 2, 5}  - needs at least one of these
# Range 2: {1, 3}     - needs at least one of these
# Range 3: {2, 3}     - needs at least one of these
# Range 4: {4, 5}     - needs at least one of these
